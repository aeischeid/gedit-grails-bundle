bundle assembled by Aaron Eischeid, 

 - install script only tested on current Ubuntu (9.10)

manually install plugins and styles by placing in ~/.gnome2/gedit file 

12/29/09 - 
  updating install script to automatically insert plugins and snippets as 
  described above. choose autoComplete plugin over word completion because it 
  doesn't conflict with the snippets plugin. still trying to find where to put 
  grails tags now. Currently it is a mystery they and won't show up inside of 
  gedit. considering getting rid of them and focusing on improving snippets.

12/30/09 - 
  improving by small degrees the groovy.lang file for groovy syntax highlighting.

01/06/10 - 
  updating snippets - add/re-adding couple plugins - slightly modded oblivion 
  color scheme should do "sudo apt-get install ack-grep" if you want to have a 
  faster find in files plugin.

03/16/10 - 
  updating snippets - clones of html and js snippets for use in gsp's, and java 
  snippets for use in groovy files. found the ctrl+space helper for snippet 
  suggestions.
