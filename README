bundle created by Aaron Eischeid, install script only tested on Ubuntu 8.04 - 9.04 (working on 9.10)

manually install plugins and styles by placing in ~/.gnome2/gedit file 

12/29/09 - updating install script to automatically insert plugins and snippets as described above. choose autoComplete plugin over word completion because it doesn't conflict with the snippets plugin.
  still trying to find where to put grails tags now. Currently it is a mystery they and won't show up inside of gedit. considering getting rid of them and focusing on improving snippets.

12/30/09 - improving by small degrees the groovy.lang file for groovy syntax highlighting.  

01/06/10 - updating snippets - add/re-adding couple plugins - slightly modded oblivion color scheme
